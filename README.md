# Guitar Tuner

Tune your guitar by ear. Use the space key to advance. Use arrow keys to go forward or backward. Use 1-6 keys to trigger specific string. Use enter to stop.

## Available Tunings

```javascript
const tuning = {
	standard: {
		label: "Standard",
		notes: ['e2', 'a2', 'd3', 'g3', 'b3', 'e4']
	},
	dropD: {
		label: "Drop D",
		notes: ['d2', 'a2', 'd3', 'g3', 'b3', 'e4']
	},
	dadgad: {
		label: "DADGAD",
		notes: ['d2', 'a2', 'd3', 'g3', 'a4', 'd4']
	},
};
```

Left to do:
1. Make responsive
2. Add other tunings
3. Include some basic configurable settings
